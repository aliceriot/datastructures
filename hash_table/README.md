#Hash table

OK, we're going to make a hash table! Cool! What is a hash table? Well,
it's basically a data structure that implements an associative array. An
associative array is an ADT that is a set of key-value pairs, where
a particular key may appear at most once in the array. There are a couple
of operations that are commonly supported, like inserting a new key-value
pair, getting the value associated with a particular key, deleting
a key-value pair, and so on.

All that is great, but how do we actually implement it? Well, there are
a variety of choices to be made. This image stolen from wikipedia gives us
an idea of what we're shooting for:
