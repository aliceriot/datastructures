# Data Structures in C

I decided to implement some basic data structures and a few operations on
them in C. I thought this would be a useful exercise for a couple reasons:
firstly because I learn well by trying to do things and writing about
them, and secondly because when I'm done I'll have a nice library I can
use for subsequent C projects!

This repo is basically a directory repo, all of the individual data
structures are submodules. If you want to pull them all in you can clone
the repo and then do:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Or you can just go look at the [hash
table](https://github.com/aliceriot/hashtable) and [linked
list](https://github.com/aliceriot/hashtable) repos. Each repo has
a little essay (the README) that I wrote as I was writing it. Writing is
so helpful for learning this stuff! You'll also find a `.h` file that
gives you all you need to use the data structure, and a `.c` file that has
tests in it (also serves as usage examples).
