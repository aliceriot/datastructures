#Data Structures in C

I decided to implement some basic data structures and a few operations on
them in C. I thought this would be a useful exercise for a couple reasons:
firstly because I learn well by trying to do things and writing about
them, and secondly because when I'm done I'll have a nice library I can
use for subsequent C projects!

There's a directory for each type of data structure (tree, linked list,
etc) which has a little essay/overview in it about the code I wrote, along
with a `.h` file containing the structs and functions necessary for that
data structure and a `.c` file containing some tests and usage examples.
